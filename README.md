Technologies Used
Android Studio: Integrated development environment (IDE) for Android development.
Java: Programming language used for the application logic.
XML: Markup language used for defining the user interface layout.
AndroidX: Library for backward compatibility and modern Android features.
Volley: Library for network operations to fetch movie data.
RecyclerView: Widget for displaying scrollable lists of elements.
ConstraintLayout: Layout manager used to create complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy.
ShapeableImageView: Customizable ImageView from the Material Components library.


Key Features
Dynamic Movie Details Display: The UI dynamically displays various movie details, including:
Movie Title
Rating: Displayed with a star icon.
Duration and Date: Icons used for better visual representation.
Synopsis: Brief summary of the movie.
Actors: List of starring actors.
ScrollView for Content Display: Utilizes NestedScrollView to allow vertical scrolling of movie details, ensuring all information is accessible regardless of screen size.
RecyclerView for Image Gallery: Integrates a RecyclerView to show a gallery of images related to the movie.


Interactive Elements:
Favorite Button: Allows users to mark a movie as a favorite.
Back Button: For easy navigation back to the previous screen.
Progress Indicator: A ProgressBar to indicate loading status while data is being fetched from the network.


Layout Details
Main Layout: Defined using ConstraintLayout to ensure a responsive and adaptive UI design.
NestedScrollView: Ensures all content is scrollable without cutting off any information on smaller screens.
ConstraintLayouts within ScrollView: For organizing various UI components hierarchically.
ShapeableImageView: For displaying movie posters or related images with custom shapes.


Code Structure
Java Activity: Handles the logic for fetching and displaying movie data. Initializes UI components and manages data-binding.
XML Layout: Defines the visual structure of the UI. Utilizes various Android widgets and layouts to achieve a user-friendly interface.
Challenges and Solutions
Implicit Casting Issue: Initially faced an issue with casting ScrollView to NestedScrollView. Resolved by ensuring the correct type is used consistently in both XML and Java code.
Dynamic Content Handling: Ensured that the UI updates dynamically with the data fetched from the server using Volley, handling potential delays with a progress bar.


Future Enhancements
Data Caching: Implementing caching mechanisms to reduce network calls and improve app performance.
Enhanced Interactivity: Adding more interactive elements such as user reviews, trailers, and recommendation systems.
UI Improvements: Refining the UI for a more modern look, potentially integrating more material design components.
This project demonstrates a practical application of various Android development techniques to create a functional and user-friendly movie information app.
